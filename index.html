            <p>Computers have been a technology that has advanced our way to do anything. We are able to think something and with little effort we can make that idea a reality. We can prototype and design
                anything we wish. This works on the basis of OS and the four layers of programming that exists. At the bottom we have hardware, then
                it is machine language. Next we take the machine language and give value to it with assembly language. Lastly we have what everyone knows which is High-level language which is a coding language to write code.
                This is the super power of the modern world, with this we enabled paying with our phones to just the creation of our phones, ability to connect to data and pull information from the internet. To these newest of technologies 
                the abilty to have artificial intellegience help us in our daily task and remind us of things or let us understand topics like to a teacher would teach us certain topics. All of this was started from some
                ones and zeros and our ability to decide how to combine them together so we can make things operate. We can thank Alan turing for his finding.

            <p>Vegetables are really good for you and should be a big part of your diet. They have lots of important things like vitamins, minerals, and fiber that help keep you healthy. Vegetables come in all sorts of colors, shapes, and sizes, and they taste really good too.
